Configuration

* Configuration of the licenses.xml file

  You can simply give a particular {{{./licenses.html}licenses.xml}} file which contains the
  different licenses.

  The {{{./licenses.html}licenses.xml}} is being searched for in the following folder
  <<$\{project.basedir\}/src/licenses/licenses.xml>>.
  That means if you don't give any <<licenseFile>> information in the configuration
  MLV will search for a <<<licenses.xml>>> file in the defined default folder.

  The following configuration is only needed if you don't store the licenses.xml file
  in the default location.

+----
<configuration>
  <licenseFile>${basedir}/src/etc/license.xml</licenseFile>
</configuration>
+----

* Exclude artifacts

  If you have artifacts which do not contain a valid license (e.g. log4j 1.2.12) you can simply exclude
  those artifacts from being checked during the check cycle.

  The pattern for the check is groupId:artifactId:version:type:classifier.

+----
<configuration>
  <excludes>
    <exclude>org.antlr:antlr-runtime:jar:3.3</exclude>
  </excludes>
</configuration>
+----

* Company wide setup

  In a company you have other requirements than in a simple single module
  project. In a company you would like to setup a single parent pom which
  contains the configuration for the Maven License Verifier Plugin and also
  a different package which contains the <<<licenses.xml>>> file which contains
  the accepted licenses for the company. This can be achieved by using a
  supplemental dependency which contains only the licenses.xml file.

  This can simply be achieved by using a setup like the following.

+----
<project>
  ...
  <build>
    <plugins>
      <plugin>
        <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
        <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
        <dependencies>
          <dependency>
            <groupId>com.company.licenses</groupId>
            <artifactId>allprojects</artifactId>
            <version>1.0</version>
          </dependency
        </dependencies>
        <configuration>
          <!-- Optional you can put your configurations here -->
        </configuration>
      </plugin>
    </plugins>
  </build>
  ...
</project>
+----

  The above package (allprojects) can be simply created as a simple Maven
  project which comprises of the following folder structure.

+----
.
|-- pom.xml
`-- src
    `-- main
        `-- resources
            `-- licenses
                `-- licenses.xml
+----

  To create such a project you need the following pom. The only thing which
  is more or less fixed is the location of the <<<licenses.xml>>> file, but
  the naming of the artifact and of course the package is your turn.

+----
<groupId>com.soebes.mlv.plugin.licenses</groupId>
<artifactId>oss</artifactId>
<packaging>jar</packaging>
<version>1.0</version>
<name>Licenses Configuration Files</name>

<build>
  <plugins>
    <plugin>
      <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-resources-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>2.3</version>
      <configuration>
        <encoding>UTF-8</encoding>
      </configuration>
    </plugin>
  </plugins>
</build>
+----
