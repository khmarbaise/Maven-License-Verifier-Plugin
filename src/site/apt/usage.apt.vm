* Information

  The goals for the MLVP are bound to their respective phases in the
  build lifecycle.

  The default binding is to run the MLVP at the <<prepare-package>> phase. If you like to change
  this you have to make an appropriate configuration.

* Configuration

  The most important thing you have to do is to create a {{{./licenses.html}licenses.xml}}
  file which contains the different categories. The default location where the MLVP
  will check if a <<<licenses.xml>>> exists is in the <<<src/licenses>>> folder.
  It can be {{{./verify-mojo.html#licenseFile}configured}} if you need to.
