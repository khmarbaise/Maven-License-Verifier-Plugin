Examples


* Usage Example

  If we take a real project and add the configuration for the
  Maven License Verifier Plugin into its pom like the following:

+-----
  <plugin>
    <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
    <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
    <executions>
      <execution>
        <id>license-verifier</id>
        <goals>
          <goal>verify</goal>
        </goals>
      </execution>
    </exectuions>
  </plugin>
+-----

  And of course create a <<<licenses.xml>>> file with the following contents:

+-----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<licenses>
  <valid>
    <license>
      <id>Apache Software License 2.0</id>

  This will produce an output like the following the during a <<<mvn clean package>>>
  call (The output contains only an excerpt of the original output).

  Taking a closer look to the artifacts like the <antlr:antlr:jar:2.7.7> you
  will find out that this artifact has a <<BSD License>> which is currently not
  in the <<<licenses.xml>>> file. This means in other words if we will accept the
  <<BSD license>> we have to add that license to the <<<licenses.xml>>> file in
  an appropriate category. The following will show you an appropriate excerpt
  of the <<<licenses.xml>>> file. In this case we put the license into <Valid>
  category.

+----
  <valid>
    [...]
    <license>
      <id>BSD License</id>
      <description>BSD License</description>
      <names>
        <name>BSD License</name>
      </names>
      <urls>
        <url>http://www.antlr.org/license.html</url>
      </urls>
    </license>
    [...]
  </valid>
+----

  The result of the above change is the following output:

+----

  This will just remove only a single warning in this case for the
  <antlr:antlr:jar:2.7.7> artifact. To get rid of the warnings for the other
  artifacts we have to added appropriate entries in to the <<<licenses.xml>>>
  files as well.

  If you take a look at the <org.antlr:antlr-runtime:jar:3.3> artifact you will
  find out that this artifact itself does not have a license entry nor its
  parent has one. This means this artifact does not contain a licens eat all.
  In this case you have to exclude this artifact from being checked which
  simply means to enhance the configuration section of the plugin like
  the following:

+-------
  <plugin>
    <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>
    <artifactId>${project.artifactId}</artifactId>
    <version>${project.version}</version>
    <executions>
      <execution>
        <id>license-verifier</id>
        <goals>
          <goal>verify</goal>
        </goals>
        <configuration>
          <excludes>
            <exclude>org.antlr:antlr-runtime:jar:3.3</exclude>
          </excludes>
        </configuration>
      </execution>
    </exectuions>
  </plugin>
+-------

  After changing the configuration the output of a <<<mvn clean package>>>
  looks like this:

+-------
[INFO]
[INFO] --- maven-license-verifier-plugin:${project.version}:verify (license-verifier) @ sapm ---
[INFO] Loading /home/kama/ws-git/sapm/src/licenses/licenses.xml licenses file.
[WARNING] ]UNKNOWN[ (compile) The artifact org.antlr:stringtemplate:jar:3.2.1 has a license which is categorized as unknown
[WARNING] ]UNKNOWN[ (test) The artifact org.beanshell:bsh:jar:2.0b4 has a license which is categorized as unknown
[INFO]
+-------

  So we have to continue and check the artifact <org.antlr:stringtemplate:jar:3.2.1>.
  This artifact has a <BSD License> as well, but why hasn't it been categorized
  as being <valid>? The simple answer is: It has a different URL <<<http://antlr.org/license.html>>>
  instead of <<<http://www.antlr.org/license.html>>>. So we have to add the
  other URL into the <<<licenses.xml>>>.

+----
  <valid>
    [...]
    <license>
      <id>BSD License</id>
      <description>BSD License</description>
      <names>
        <name>BSD License</name>
      </names>
      <urls>
        <url>http://www.antlr.org/license.html</url>
        <url>http://antlr.org/license.html</url>
      </urls>
    </license>
    [...]
  </valid>
+----

  After this change the output looks now like the following:

+-----
[INFO]
[INFO] --- maven-license-verifier-plugin:0.3-SNAPSHOT:verify (license-verifier) @ sapm ---
[INFO] Loading /home/kama/ws-git/sapm/src/licenses/licenses.xml licenses file.
[WARNING] ]UNKNOWN[ (test) The artifact org.beanshell:bsh:jar:2.0b4 has a license which is categorized as unknown
[INFO]
+-----

  The final artifact itself does not contain the license only it's parent
  contains the license which it this case is (excerpt from the parents pom.xml).

+-----
 <licenses>
    <license>
      <name>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</name>
      <url>http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.txt</url>
    </license>
  </licenses>
+-----

  Now finally we have to add this license to our <<<licenses.xml>>> file.

+-----
  <valid>
    [...]
    <license>
      <id>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</id>
      <description>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</description>
      <names>
       <name>GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</name>
      </names>
      <urls>
        <url>http://www.gnu.org/licenses/lglp.txt</url>
      </urls>
    </license>
    [...]
 </valid>
+-----

  And now finally the output of the <<<mvn clean package>>> looks like this:

+----
[INFO]
[INFO] --- maven-license-verifier-plugin:0.3-SNAPSHOT:verify (license-verifier) @ sapm ---
[INFO] Loading /home/kama/ws-git/sapm/src/licenses/licenses.xml licenses file.
