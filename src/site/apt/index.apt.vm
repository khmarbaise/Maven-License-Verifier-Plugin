Maven License Verifier Plugin


  The basic idea of the Maven License Verifier Plugin (MLVP for short) is to
  check which licenses are used by your projects artifacts and give some hints
  about artifacts which don't define a license at all or artifacts which
  use a license which is not acceptable in your project or company.

  This will sometimes be called License Compliance Management, but this
  plugin will support your work but of course doesn't take the job itself.

* Goals Overview

  There are currently two goals <{{{./verify-mojo.html}verify}}> and
  <{{{./report-mojo.html}report}}> which can be used to check your project
  during build time or create a report about the used licenses.

* Usage

  If you like to use the MLVP plugin you have to define the plugin in your
  <<<pom.xml>>> either in the area of the build to do a verification during
  the build. On the other hand you can use the MLVP plugin in the <reporting>
  area of the to produce a report during site generation about the used licenses.

  In both cases you have to define the location of a {{{./licenses.html}licenses.xml}}
  file which contains the definition of the different {{{./categories.html}categories}} of
  licenses.
