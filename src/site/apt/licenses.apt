The Licenses File

* Basics

  The MLVP plugin categorizes the different licenses based on the configuration
  file which gives you the freedom to define whatever licenses you wish and categorize
  them by your needs.

* The License file composition

 Basically you have three areas which you have to fill up with appropriate
 license informations. The first area is the <<valid>> area which contains
 licenses which will be categorized as <<Valid>>. The second area is the
 <<invalid>> area which contains the licenses which will be categorizes as
 <<Invalid>>. And the third area is the <<warning>> area which contains the
 licenses which will be categorizes as <<Warning>>.

</licenses>

* Valid, Invalid, Warning Area

 Inside the <<valid>>, <<invalid>> or <<warning>> area you can define as many
 licenses you wish. This is needed to support any use case, cause different
 projects use different licenses or use more than one licenses.

 The most important thing to understand is that a license can be known or used
 under more than one name or URL.

 The following example will give you an impression. The <<description>> tag is
 only a name for the license which is used to identify it from the user point of
 view. As you can see a license is often known under different names which can
 be defined in the <<names>> list. The used <<name>> is the name which is given
 in the {{{http://maven.apache.org/pom.html#Licenses}pom}} for an artifact.
 Based on the nature that the name is given by the maintainers them self it's
 not unusual to have different names for the same license.

 The same can happen for the URL, cause it can simply reference a web site or
 a particular document or the web site is references with or
 without the prefixing <<www>> etc.

 It is very important to mention that the <<id>> has to be unique over all
 licenses independent if they are <<valid>>, <<invalid>> or <<warning>>.
