Maven License Verifier Plugin

* Information

  The goals for the Verifier Plugin are bound to their respective phases in the
  build lifecycle.

  The default binding is to run the MLV at the test phase. If you like to change
  this you have to make an appropriate configuration.
  Hint: Sometimes this does not work, cause at that time the dependencies have not been solved (Check this!)

  The most important thing you have to do first is to create one or more {{{licenses.html}licenses.xml}} files
  which contain the license information.

* Configuration

  The most important thing you have to do is to create a {{{licenses.html}licenses.xml}} file
  which comprises of the different categories and give the location of the licenses.xml
  file in the configuration of the MLV plugin.
