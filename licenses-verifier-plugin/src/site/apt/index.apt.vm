Maven License Verifier Plugin


  The basic idea of the Maven License Verifier Plugin (MLV for sort) is to
  check which licenses are used in your project and give some hints about
  artifacts which don't define a license at all or artifacts which 
  use artifact which are not acceptable in your project or company.
  
  This will sometimes called License Compliance Management, but this
  Plugin will only supports in such area and does not take over the job.
  
* Goals Overview

  There are currently two goals (check, report) which can be used to check
  your project and create a report about the used licenses.
   
* Usage

  If you like to use the MLV Plugin you have to use of the plugin
  in your pom either in the area of the build to do a check 
  during the build and on the other hand you can use 
  MLV plugin in the area of the reporting to produce a report
  about the used licenses.
  
  In both cases you have to define the location of a {{{licenses.html}licenses.xml}}
  file which contains the definition of the different {{{categories.html}}categories}} of
  licenses.
