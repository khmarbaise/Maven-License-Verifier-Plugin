# Maven License Verifier Plugin

# Overview

If you are working with Maven it often happens that someone adds a new library to 
a project cause its needed somehow (or whatevery the reason is). The problem with 
such cases is: What kind of license does this library have? Is it one of the 
allowed licenses in the company?  Or is it a critical license(for example GPL in 
commerical environment)?

This plugin can help you in the above situations. It will check the licenses of
all artifacts during every build against a list of valid licenses or licenses which should
be checked in more detail (warning) or unknown licenses or invalid licenses.
