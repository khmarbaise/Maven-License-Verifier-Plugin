# Maven License Verifier Plugin

# Overview

If you are working with Maven it often happens that someone adds a new library to 
a project cause its needed somehow (or whatevery the reason is). The problem with 
such cases is: What kind of license does this library have? Is it one of the 
allowed licenses in the company?  Or is it a critical license(for example GPL in 
commerical environment)?

This plugin can help you in the above situations. It will check the licenses of
all artifacts during every build against a list of valid licenses or licenses which should
be checked in more detail (warning) or unknown licenses or invalid licenses.

## Usage

The first and simplest usage is to configure the Maven Licenses Verifier Plugin

    <plugin>
      <groupId>com.soebes.maven.plugins.mlv</groupId>
      <artifactId>maven-license-verifier-plugin</artifactId>
      <version>0.4</version>
      <executions>
        <execution>
          <phase>test</phase>
          <goals>
            <goal>check</goal>
          </goals>
        </execution>
      </executions>
    </plugin>

## Settings Configuration

If you like you can configure an appropriate plugin group in your
settings.xml file to make life a little bit easier.

    <settings>
      ...
      <pluginGroups>
        <pluginGroup>com.soebes.maven.plugins.mlv</pluginGroup>
      </pluginGroups>
      ...
    </settings>

The above setting makes it possible to call the plugin on command 
line simply:

  mvn license-verifier:check
